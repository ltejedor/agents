AI agent workflows designed to save you time when developing products - across research, development, testing, marketing, and sales.

## About the Project

**30 Agents in 30 Days** is a challenge to create and share 30 practical AI agent workflows that help product builders save time and improve their process. Each day, a new agent workflow is released to help with different aspects of the product development lifecycle.

## Project Structure

Each agent workflow is contained in its own folder with complete documentation, code, and instructions for implementation.
