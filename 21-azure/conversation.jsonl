One of the most reputable organizations is the **Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF)**, which often partners with local training providers. Here are some recommended places:\n\n### 1. **Bay Area Motorcycle Training (BAMT)**  \n   - **Locations**: South San Francisco, Vallejo, and other Bay Area locations.  \n   - **Details**: They offer the California Motorcyclist Safety Program (CMSP), which includes beginner and intermediate safety courses. BAMT instructors are highly rated for their patience and expertise.  \n   - **Website**: [www.bayareamotorcycletraining.com](http://www.bayareamotorcycletraining.com)\n\n### 2. **Pacific Motorcycle Training (PMT)**  \n   - **Locations**: San Francisco (at City College) and other nearby areas like San Jose and Livermore.  \n   - **Details**: PMT also offers the CMSP curriculum with state-certified instructors. Their classes focus on building confidence and safety skills for new and returning riders.  \n   - **Website**: [www.pacificmotorcycletraining.com](http://www.pacificmotorcycletraining.com)\n\n### 3. **Learn to Ride Motorcycles**  \n   - **Location**: Oakland (short drive from SF).  \n   - **Details**: A small, personalized program that caters to beginners, offering tailored one-on-one or small group lessons.

Check with your training provider for specific requirements.  \n- If you\u0027re nervous, start with an Introductory Motorcycle Experience (offered by many providers), which is less structured than the Basic Rider Course.\n\nHope you enjoy your learning journey!
