# Proof of Work LLM System

A system for tracking and visualizing LLM tool calls based on user needs.

## System Components

- **Tool Tracking**: Module to intercept and log LLM tool calls
- **Data Storage**: Save and manage tool call data in structured format
- **Visualization**: Create dashboards and charts of tool usage
- **User Configuration**: Allow users to specify what tools to track
- **API**: Endpoints for accessing and configuring the system

## Implementation Steps

1. Create core tool tracking middleware
2. Implement data storage solution
3. Build visualization components
4. Develop API for user configuration
5. Create example applications

## Getting Started

This system is designed for a hackathon project to demonstrate tracking and visualization of LLM tool calls.
