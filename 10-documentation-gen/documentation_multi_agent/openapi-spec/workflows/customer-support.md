# Customer Support Workflow

This guide demonstrates how to implement a complete customer support workflow using the WhatsApp Cloud API. This workflow covers the entire lifecycle of a customer support interaction from initial contact to resolution.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Customer Initiates Contact**: Customer sends a message to your WhatsApp Business number
2. **Automated Greeting**: System sends an automatic acknowledgment
3. **Agent Assignment**: Conversation is assigned to an available agent
4. **Issue Resolution**: Agent and customer exchange messages to resolve the issue
5. **Resolution Confirmation**: Agent confirms issue resolution
6. **Feedback Collection**: Optional customer satisfaction survey

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Receive Incoming Message

Set up a webhook to receive incoming messages from customers:

### 2. Send Automated Greeting

When a customer initiates a conversation, send an automated greeting:

### 3. Assign to Agent

Implement logic to assign the conversation to an available agent:

### 4. Handle Agent Responses

Send agent responses back to the customer:

### 5. Mark Conversation as Resolved

When the issue is resolved, update the conversation status:

### 6. Collect Customer Feedback

Send a customer satisfaction survey using interactive messages:

## Complete Workflow Integration

To implement this workflow in a production environment:

1. **Set up Webhooks**: Configure your webhook endpoint to receive incoming messages
2. **Integrate with Agent Interface**: Connect to your existing CRM or helpdesk system
3. **Implement Conversation Storage**: Store conversation history and metadata
4. **Add Analytics Tracking**: Track key metrics for conversation handling
5. **Test the Complete Flow**: Verify all steps work correctly with test conversations

## Monitoring and Optimization

Once your customer support workflow is live, monitor these key metrics:

- First response time
- Average resolution time
- Agent utilization
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Conversation volume by time of day

Use these insights to optimize agent scheduling, template messages, and routing logic.

## Example System Architecture

For a scalable customer support implementation, consider this architecture:

1. **WhatsApp Cloud API**: Handles messaging with WhatsApp
2. **API Gateway**: Manages authentication and rate limiting
3. **Webhook Service**: Receives and processes incoming messages
4. **Agent Service**: Handles conversation assignment and agent state
5. **Message Service**: Manages outgoing messages and templates
6. **Analytics Service**: Tracks conversation metrics
7. **Agent Interface**: Web application for agents to handle conversations

This modular approach allows each component to scale independently as your support volume grows.
