# KILLER PUPPET
## Game Rulebook

### INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Killer Puppet, a comedic horror game where sock puppets become lethal assassins! In this text adventure, you'll create a unique puppet character with its own personality and stats, then unleash it into a deadly environment. Your puppet will be controlled by an AI that follows your strategic directives as it hunts its target while avoiding becoming prey itself.

### GAME OVERVIEW

**Game Concept:** Create a killer sockpuppet, give it a personality, and watch as AI controls it in a deadly game of cat and mouse.

**Players:** Up to 12 players

**Game Length:** Approximately 10 minutes

**Win Condition:** Be the last puppet standing

### CHARACTER CREATION

#### Choosing Your Puppet

1. **Name:** Give your killer puppet a name.

2. **Appearance:** Customize your sockpuppet's appearance (an AI-generated avatar will represent your creation).

3. **Personality Bio:** Write a brief description of your puppet's personality and strategy. The AI will use this to guide your puppet's decision-making throughout the game.

4. **Stats:** Distribute points among six key attributes:
   - **Health:** How much damage your puppet can withstand
   - **Stamina:** Energy reserves (decreases by 1 each turn)
   - **Strength:** Power in combat and ability to resist attacks
   - **Speed:** Determines turn order and evasion
   - **Stealth:** Ability to hide and ambush others
   - **Perception:** Finding hidden items and detecting other puppets

### GAME SETUP

Once all players have created their puppets, the game will:

1. Randomly place puppets in a location (Haunted Mansion, Abandoned Factory, or Secret Lair)
2. Create a secret circular assassination chain
3. Inform each puppet who their current target is

You are the hunter of your target, but remember – another puppet is hunting you!

### TURN STRUCTURE

1. **Action Selection:** The AI controlling each puppet chooses one action based on the personality bio.

2. **Initiative Determination:** Turn order is determined by a Speed check (Speed + 1d6), with ties broken by higher Stamina, and finally by random chance.

3. **Action Resolution:** Actions are resolved in initiative order.

4. **Environmental Effects:** Room hazards are applied.

5. **Stamina Reduction:** All puppets lose 1 Stamina at the end of each turn.

6. **Narrative Summary:** Each puppet receives a personalized summary of the turn's events.

### BASIC ACTIONS

#### MOVE
- Relocate to any connected room
- Other puppets in the same room can see which room you move to

#### ATTACK
- Attack another puppet in the same room
- Roll Strength + 1d6 (+ weapon bonus) vs. target's Speed + 1d6 (+ armor bonus)
- If your roll is higher, deal damage equal to the difference
- If your attack fails, lose Stamina equal to (opponent's Strength roll - your Strength roll)

#### CHASE
- Target another puppet in the same room for pursuit
- If they try to move away, you'll follow them to their destination
- If they don't move, you'll attack them

#### HIDE
- Conceal yourself in the current room
- Improves your stealth and makes you harder to detect

#### GRAB
- Pick up an item you can see in the room
- If you already have an item in that slot, you'll swap it

#### USE
- Activate your consumable item
- The item provides its benefit and is then discarded

### PASSIVE ACTIONS

#### SEARCH/LOOK
- Automatically performed when in or entering a room
- Roll Perception + 1d6 vs. item/puppet Stealth to detect hidden things
- Does not require an action

### EQUIPMENT

Each puppet can carry one item in each of four slots:
- **Weapon:** Improves attack capability
- **Armor:** Enhances defense
- **Tool:** Provides special abilities
- **Consumable:** One-time use items that restore health or stamina

### SURVIVAL MECHANICS

#### STAMINA
- Decreases by 1 at the end of each turn
- Failed attacks decrease Stamina based on Strength difference
- If Stamina reaches 0, Health decreases by 1 per turn

#### HAZARDS
- Each room may contain hazards
- Hazards trigger skill checks (Stat + 1d6)
- Failed checks result in lost Health or Stamina equal to the amount the check was failed by

### ELIMINATION

When a puppet is eliminated (Health reduced to 0):
1. All equipment is dropped in the current room
2. If eliminated by another puppet, the killer receives credit
3. The puppet that was hunting the eliminated puppet now targets their victim

### WINNING THE GAME

The last puppet standing wins, whether by eliminating all opponents or by outlasting them as they fall to hazards and stamina loss.

### ENVIRONMENTS

#### HAUNTED MANSION
A sprawling Victorian mansion with hidden passages, antique weapons, and supernatural hazards.

#### ABANDONED FACTORY
An industrial complex with machinery hazards, improvised weapons, and fewer hiding spots.

#### SECRET LAIR
An underground facility with high-tech security systems, experimental equipment, and deadly traps.

Remember, your puppet is controlled by AI based on the personality you created. Choose your strategy wisely – will you be an aggressive hunter, a cautious survivor, or something else entirely? The fate of your killer puppet is in your hands... at least until the game begins!

**Good luck, and may the best puppet survive!**
